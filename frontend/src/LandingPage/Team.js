          We are a bunch (a little larger one, maybe) of KGPians from different
          backgrounds and with diverse passion who have come together to solve
          modern problems requiring fast-moving people and "KISS" solutions; our
          aim is to make the pool of innovations and research at IITs accessible
          and understandable to everyone; from students to scientists... <br />
          <br />
          and EVERYONE between.
